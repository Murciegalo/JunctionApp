### How to contribute

To contribute to the development of this app, you should follow these steps: 

1) Find the issue you want to solve under Issues, and leave a comment indicating you're going to start working on it. In case you want to work on something that does not relate to any existing issue, please make a new Issue about it, so we can have some sort of dialogue on it first. 
2) Fork the repository, checkout the `dev` branch and start working on your issue.
3) Once you think you're ready, make sure to merge the latest code from the upstream repository (`dev` branch) into your fork (https://hackernoon.com/sync-a-fork-from-upstream-repo-in-github-c2c29c8eca3b)
4) Make a Pull Request into this repository, link the related issue there and add a few comments on what you've made.
